- [**Webb Spam Corpus 2011**](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/doi/WebbSpamCorpus.html)  
Web spam is defined as Web pages that are created to manipulate search engines and deceive Web users. As such, Web spam is regarded as one of the most important challenges currently facing search engines and Web users, and recent studies suggest that it accounts for a significant portion of all Web content. Although the problems associated with Web spam have been widely acknowledged, research efforts have been somewhat limited by the lack of a publicly available Web spam data set. To help combat this situation, the Webb Spam Corpus was created. The Webb Spam Corpus 2011 was collected by De Wang (original Webb Spam Corpus collected by Steve Webb) as part of the Denial of Information Project at the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is a first-of-its-kind, large-scale, and publicly available Web spam data set that was created using a novel, fully automated Web spam collection method. The corpus consists of nearly 350,000 Web spam pages, making it more than two orders of magnitude larger than any other previously cited Web spam data set.
