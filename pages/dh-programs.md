# Advanced Degrees in Digital Humanities

The list is meant to be global and comprehensive of all types of degrees. The list is focused on degrees and certificates granted as part of the main accreditation mechanisms of colleges and universities. The list does not take into account the main mechanisms by which a large number of practitioners continue to learn digital humanities today, namely, outside the curriculum. 

List in progress. Please submit a pull request or add an issue with your suggestion.

## Notes

For a scholarly article comparing some of these programs, see Sula, Hackney and Cunningham. "[A Survey of Digital Humanities Programs](https://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/a-survey-of-digital-humanities-programs/#Appendix_A)")

Brett Bobley, Director of ODH, started a [Google Doc list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fogyvE2qvu0BOyqvqbmIJkQ-onYTed1t00D21gJMTtk/edit) focused on the US. That list is merged here.
