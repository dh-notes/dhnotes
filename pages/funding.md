title: Funding Opportunities for Digital Humanities
---

Here is list of funding opportunities for Digital Humanities work. Some
of the funding opportunities included are meant to be used solely on digital humanities, in other cases some general funding for the humanities can be applied towards digital humanities work. This simplified list derives from the more detailed list compiled with the help of the community using [this shared spreadsheet on GoogleDocs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmgLcm5jfVhSdDZjRXBEN21sLXhKYnpQa2ZVSFQ2cWc&usp=sharing).

This list is a work in progress, and you can contribute! If you have a correction or an addition to make, please send an email to <dhfunding@ach.org> or add a ticket to [our issue tracker](http://github.com/achorg/dhfunding/issues).

Developed by **Alex Gil** and **Dennis Tenen**, with support from the ACH.
