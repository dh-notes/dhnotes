DHCommons is to make visible the important, developmental work that often goes
unseen in the midst of a DH project and to help DH scholars claim
departmental, disciplinary, and institutional credit for that labor. DHCommons
will become the robust and recognizable system of academic credit that its
practitioners require.

[**Enculturation**](http://www.enculturation.net/) is a refereed journal
devoted to contemporary theories of rhetoric, writing, and culture. We accept

approximately 1000-2000 words. We also welcome submissions to our Responses
section, which invites projects and essays that take up events, controversies,
topics, themes, terms, and ideas. Responses are scholarly works that are
theoretically informed but publicly accessible for wide audiences in a wide
variety of media.

[**Eludamos**](http://www.eludamos.org/index.php/eludamos/index) is an
international, multi-disciplined, biannual e-journal that publishes
peer-reviewed articles that theoretically and/or empirically deal with digital
games in their manifold appearances and their sociocultural-historical
contexts. ELUDAMOS positions itself as a publication that fundamentally
transgresses disciplinary boundaries. The aim is to join questions about and
approaches to computer games from decidedly heterogeneous scientific contexts
(for example cultural studies, media studies, (art) history, sociology,
(social) psychology, and semiotics) and, thus, to advance the
interdisciplinary discourse on digital games. This approach does not exclude
questions about the distinct features of digital games an aesthetic and
cultural form of articulation, on the contrary, the issue is to distinguish
their media specific characteristics as well as their similarity to other
forms of aesthetic and cultural practice. That way, the editors would like to
contribute to the lasting distinction of international game studies as an
academic discipline.

[**Ethics and Information
Technology**](http://www.springer.com/computer/swe/journal/10676) is a

## H

[**Historical Materialism**](http://www.historicalmaterialism.org/) is a
Marxist journal, appearing four times a year, based in London. Founded in
1997, it asserts that, notwithstanding the variety of its practical and
theoretical articulations, Marxism constitutes the most fertile conceptual
framework for analysing social phenomena, with an eye to their overhaul. In
our selection of materials, we do not favour any one tendency, tradition or
variant. Marx demanded the ‘merciless criticism of everything that exists’:
for us that includes Marxism itself.

[**Historical Social Research**](http://www.gesis.org/en/hsr/profile/) is an
international peer-reviewed journal for the application of formal methods in
history. The application of formal methods to history covers quantitative and
computer-assisted qualitative social research, historical sociology and social
scientific history, cliometrical research, and historical informational
science. In a broader sense, the field of Historical Social Research can be
described as an inter-/ transdisciplinary paradigm. The HSR is user-, methods-,
and data-orientated, with the journal focusing on inter- and transdisciplinary
research. An international editorial board is in charge of the content and,
thanks to close cooperation with the network partners and user organizations
within the field of historical social research, the journal participates
intensively in current research discussions.

[**History of the Present**](http://historyofthepresent.org) is a journal
devoted to history as a critical endeavor. Its aim is twofold: to create a
space in which scholars can reflect on the role history plays in establishing
categories of contemporary debate by making them appear inevitable, natural,
or culturally necessary; and to publish work that calls into question
certainties about the relationship between past and present that are taken for
granted by the majority of practicing historians. We seek to encourage the
critical examination of history’s influence on politics and the politics of
the discipline of history itself. No history journal currently published has
devoted itself specifically to fostering this work and providing a dedicated
forum for it. Indeed, at a moment when history, and the social sciences more
generally, seems preoccupied with the fantasy of retrieving pre-critical
empirical knowledge, a journal committed to history as a form of critique
seems more necessary than ever. It is in the rigorous, theoretically-informed
writing of history, based mainly on evidence from archives, texts, and other
sources, rather than writing about “history” from an abstract philosophical or
historiographical perspective, that our contributors will offer readers an
alternative to approaches that predominate in existing journals.

\*[**Human Computation**](http://hcjournal.org) is an international and
interdisciplinary forum for the electronic publication and print archiving of
high-quality scholarly articles in all areas of human computation, which
concerns the design or analysis of information processing systems in which
humans participate as computational elements.

[**Human IT**](http://etjanst.hb.se/bhs/ith/humanit-eng.htm) is a
multi-disciplinary and scholarly journal with the goal of  bringing forth new
research and discussion about digital media as  communicative, aesthetic, and
ludic instruments. The journal is closely  aligned with the new field of
research which is alternatively referred  to as humanities computing, social
informatics, or informatica  umanistica. We welcome contributions from the
humanities, the social,  behavioural, and natural sciences, as well as
technology. Human IT  aspires to be a forum for new research which risks
falling outside of  the borders of intra-disciplinary channels of publication
as a result of  its multi-disciplinary approach or unorthodox choice of
subject. A  consequence of this interdisciplinary ambition is that Human IT is
published jointly by the departments of the University College of Borås.  It
also works with an extended editorial board which includes  representatives
from many different scholarly disciplines, practices,  and countries.

[**Humanist Studies & the Digital
Age**](http://journals.oregondigital.org/hsda) is devoted to the reformulation
of received philological and philosophical ideas of writing and reading
literary works, motivated by the advent of electronic texts. The journal
encourages new theoretical engagements based on comparative media studies,
translations and interdisciplinary approaches to a new humanist philology, and
a new humanist philosophy, made possible by digital technology. While the
Editorial Board considers studies on Petrarch and the humanist age in all its
manifestations and the Oregon Petrarch Open Book the seminal topics of
discussion of HUMANIST STUDIES & THE DIGITAL AGE, we also encourage submissions
that investigate more generally the interface of philological, interpretative,
and digital inquiry.

\*[**Hyperrhiz**](http://hyperrhiz.io/) is an open access publication produced
twice-yearly along with our parent journal Rhizomes: Cultural Studies in
Emerging Knowledge and our monograph series project Electric Press. We welcome
submissions of net art, new media scholarship and criticism, and reviews of
media-related books or blogs. For submission criteria, please read our latest
call for papers and our guidelines for submissions.

[**Information & Culture: A Journal of
History**](http://www.infoculturejournal.org/about) publishes high-quality,
peer reviewed articles on the history of information. The journal honors its
(45+ year) heritage by continuing to publish in the areas of library,
archival, museum, conservation, and information science history. However, the
journal's scope has been broadened significantly beyond these areas to include
the historical study of any topic that would fall under the purview of any of
the modern interdisciplinary schools of information, such as the school in
which the journal is edited, the School of Information at The University of
Texas at Austin. In keeping with the spirit of the information schools, the
work is human centered and looks at the interactions of people, organizations,
and societies with information and technologies. Social and cultural context
of information and information technology, viewed from an historical
perspective, is at the heart of the journal's interests. Typical papers might
focus, among other topics, on the histories of information institutions,
academic domains, professions, work, and societies. The intention is to
juxtapose papers on a wide variety of topics related to the history of
information so as to stimulate connections that have not been made, for
example between the research of library historians, historians of computing,
labor historians, gender historians, economic historians, business historians,
political and diplomatic historians, cultural studies scholars, critical
theorists, and science and technology scholars.

or theoretical framework, but questions the mutual shaping of literary and
visual cultures. Beside tackling theoretical issues, it is a platform for
reviews of real life examples. Each issue features three parts: 1) a thematic
cluster, guest-edited by specialized scholars in the field; 2) a selection of
various articles; 3) reviews of recent publications. Image [&] Narrative is a
bilingual journal, which publishes contributions in either English or French,
and which fosters cross-cultural and interdisciplinary dialogue between
linguistic and scientific traditions.

[**The Journal for the History of Knowledge**](https://journalhistoryknowledge.org/) is an open access, peer-reviewed journal devoted to
the history of knowledge in its broadest sense. This includes the study of science, but also of
indigenous, artisanal, and other types of knowledge as well as the history of knowledge
developed in the humanities and social sciences. Special attention is paid to interactions and
processes of demarcation between science and other forms of knowledge. Contributions may deal
with the history of concepts of knowledge, the study of knowledge making practices and
institutions and sites of knowledge production, adjudication, and legitimation (including
universities). Contributions which highlight the relevance of the history of knowledge to
current policy concerns (for example, by historicizing and problematizing concepts such as the
"knowledge society") are particularly welcome.

\*[**The Journal of Interactive Technology and
Pedagogy**](http://jitp.commons.gc.cuny.edu/) promotes open scholarly
discourse around critical and creative uses of digital technology in teaching,
learning, and research. Educational institutions have often embraced
instrumentalist conceptions and market-driven implementations of technology
that overdetermine its uses in academic environments. Such approaches
underestimate the need for critical engagement with the integration of
technological tools into pedagogical practice. The JITP endeavors to counter
these trends by recentering questions of pedagogy in our discussions of
technology in higher education. The journal also works to change what counts
as scholarship—and how it is presented, disseminated, and reviewed—by allowing
contributors to develop their ideas, publish their work, and engage their
readers using multiple formats.

elegance. We do not accept fiction or poetry; we do accept images, videos, and
sound recordings used in the presentation of notes. NANO welcomes creative
reflections, spirited debate, and cross-disciplinary dialogue.

[**New Directions in the
Humanities**](http://thehumanities.com/publications/journal) provide a space
for dialogue and publication of new knowledge which builds on the past
traditions of the humanities whilst setting a renewed agenda for their future.
The humanities are a domain of learning, reflection and action, and a place of
dialogue between and across epistemologies, perspectives and content areas. It
is in these unsettling places that the humanities might be able to unburden
modern knowledge systems of their restrictive narrowness. Discussions in the
New Directions in the Humanities Collection range from the broad and
speculative to the microcosmic and empirical. Their over-riding concern,
however, is to redefine our understandings of the human and mount a case for
the disciplinary practices of the humanities. At a time when the dominant
rationalisms are running a course that often seem to draw humanity towards
less than satisfactory ends, these journals reopen the question of the
human—for highly pragmatic as well as redemptory reasons.

[**New Media & Society**](http://nms.sagepub.com/) is a top-ranked,
peer-reviewed, international journal that publishes key research from

relationship between theory, policy and practice.

[**nonsite.org**](http://nonsite.org) emerges in part out of interest in a set
of theoretical topics – the ontology of the work of art, the question of
intentionality, the ongoing appeal of different and sometimes competing
materialisms – and in part out of opposition to the dominant accounts of those
topics. Today, the various theoretical forms of neoliberalism – from the
postmodern to the posthuman, from the new historicism to the new pluralism –
have become so pervasive that they are nearly invisible. nonsite.org seeks
first to make them visible and then to make them less pervasive. Our goal is
to criticize what is and replace it with what we think ought to be.
nonsite.org is an online peer-reviewed quarterly journal of scholarship in the
humanities, plus poetry, editorials, reviews, visual art and more.
nonsite.org also features “the Tank,” a forum for comment on provocative new
scholarly work.

the consequences of these diverse disturbances for educational and cultural
institutions.

[**Thresholds**](http://openthresholds.org/) is a digital journal for
criticism in the spaces between, expected to debut Summer 2016. The journal's
platform bears witness to the dynamic processes that constitute reading and
writing by way of a split-screen digital architecture. On the left side of the
screen, we publish short essays (essayer — trial, attempt, test). The right
side of the screen is populated by the various text fragments, images, audio,
and video clips that inspired the author and propelled the corresponding work.
Unlike a footnote or endnote, these fragments are not explicitly harnessed to
the essay's main body; they do not rustle the reader toward a specific
interpretative conclusion. Instead, they invite the reader to engage in a
series of generative traversals across the central threshold. In this way,
thresholds models criticism as a restless and unruly venture that takes place
in the spaces between readers, writers, and texts.

[**Transformations**](http://www.transformationsjournal.org) is an
