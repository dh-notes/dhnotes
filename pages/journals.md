approaches to computer games from decidedly heterogeneous scientific contexts
(for example cultural studies, media studies, (art) history, sociology,
(social) psychology, and semiotics) and, thus, to advance the interdisciplinary
discourse on digital games. This approach does not exclude questions about the
distinct features of digital games a an aesthetic and cultural form of
articulation, on the contrary, the issue is to distinguish their media specific
characteristics as well as their similarity to other forms of aesthetic and
cultural practice. That way, the editors would like to contribute to the
lasting distinction of international game studies as an academic discipline.

[**Historical Materialism**](http://www.historicalmaterialism.org/) is a
Marxist journal, appearing four times a year, based in London. Founded in
1997, it asserts that, notwithstanding the variety of its practical and
theoretical articulations, Marxism constitutes the most fertile conceptual
framework for analysing social phenomena, with an eye to their overhaul. In
our selection of materials, we do not favour any one tendency, tradition or
variant. Marx demanded the ‘merciless criticism of everything that exists’:
for us that includes Marxism itself.

[**Historical Social Research**](http://www.gesis.org/en/hsr/profile/) is an

research which is alternatively referred  to as humanities computing, social
informatics, or informatica  umanistica. We welcome contributions from the
humanities, the social,  behavioural, and natural sciences, as well as
technology. Human IT  aspires to be a forum for new research which risks
falling outside of  the borders of intra-disciplinary channels of publication
as a result of  its multi-disciplinary approach or unorthodox choice of
subject. A  consequence of this interdisciplinary ambition is that Human IT is 
published jointly by the departments of the University College of Borås.  It
also works with an extended editorial board which includes  representatives
from many different scholarly disciplines, practices,  and countries.

translations and interdisciplinary approaches to a new humanist philology, and
a new humanist philosophy, made possible by digital technology. While the
Editorial Board considers studies on Petrarch and the humanist age in all its
manifestations and the Oregon Petrarch Open Book the seminal topics of
discussion of HUMANIST STUDIES & THE DIGITAL AGE, we also encourage submissions
that investigate more generally the interface of philological, interpretative,
and digital inquiry.

peer reviewed articles on the history of information. The journal honors its
(45+ year) heritage by continuing to publish in the areas of library, archival,
museum, conservation, and information science history. However, the journal's
scope has been broadened significantly beyond these areas to include the
historical study of any topic that would fall under the purview of any of the
modern interdisciplinary schools of information, such as the school in which
the journal is edited, the School of Information at The University of Texas at
Austin. In keeping with the spirit of the information schools, the work is
human centered and looks at the interactions of people, organizations, and
societies with information and technologies. Social and cultural context of

other topics, on the histories of information institutions, academic domains,
professions, work, and societies. The intention is to juxtapose papers on a
wide variety of topics related to the history of information so as to stimulate
connections that have not been made, for example between the research of
library historians, historians of computing, labor historians, gender
historians, economic historians, business historians, political and diplomatic

broad range of scholarship includes the English, American, and European  novel,
nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance  art.

[**New American Notes Online**](http://www.nanocrit.com/mission/) The goal at
NANO is to invigorate humanities discourse by publishing brief, peer-reviewed
reports with a fast turnaround enabled by new technologies. We welcome original
notes from all fields in the humanities, particularly literature, film,
history, music, rhetoric, philosophy, art, and digital humanities. We also

psychology, sociology, engineering, various fields of technology, the hard
sciences, and business. Each issue focuses on a special topic designed to
encourage new interpretations and new possibilities. We abjure jargon,
pandering, and ad hominem responses. Our ethos is brevity, clarity, and
elegance. We do not accept fiction or poetry; we do accept images, videos, and
sound recordings used in the presentation of notes. NANO welcomes creative
reflections, spirited debate, and cross-disciplinary dialogue.

[**New Directions in the
Humanities**](http://thehumanities.com/publications/journal) provide a space
for dialogue and publication of new knowledge which builds on the past
traditions of the humanities whilst setting a renewed agenda for their future.
The humanities are a domain of learning, reflection and action, and a place of
dialogue between and across epistemologies, perspectives and content areas. It
is in these unsettling places that the humanities might be able to unburden
modern knowledge systems of their restrictive narrowness. Discussions in the
New Directions in the Humanities Collection range from the broad and
speculative to the microcosmic and empirical. Their over-riding concern,
however, is to redefine our understandings of the human and mount a case for
the disciplinary practices of the humanities. At a time when the dominant
rationalisms are running a course that often seem to draw humanity towards less
than satisfactory ends, these journals reopen the question of the human—for
highly pragmatic as well as redemptory reasons.

[**New Media & Society**](http://nms.sagepub.com/) is a top-ranked,
peer-reviewed, international journal that publishes key research from
communication, media and cultural studies, as well as sociology, geography,
anthropology, economics, the political and information sciences and the
humanities. It is committed to high-quality research that explores the
relationship between theory, policy and practice.

[**nonsite.org**](http://nonsite.org) emerges in part out of interest in a set
of theoretical topics – the ontology of the work of art, the question of
intentionality, the ongoing appeal of different and sometimes competing
materialisms – and in part out of opposition to the dominant accounts of those
topics. Today, the various theoretical forms of neoliberalism – from the
postmodern to the posthuman, from the new historicism to the new pluralism –
have become so pervasive that they are nearly invisible. nonsite.org seeks
first to make them visible and then to make them less pervasive. Our goal is to
criticize what is and replace it with what we think ought to be. nonsite.org is
an online peer-reviewed quarterly journal of scholarship in the humanities,
plus poetry, editorials, reviews, visual art and more.  nonsite.org also
features “the Tank,” a forum for comment on provocative new scholarly work.

[**Philological
Encounters**](http://www.brill.com/products/journal/philological-encounters)

philosophical critique of philology. The journal encourages critical and
comparative perspectives that integrate textual scholarship and the study of
language from across the world. Alongside four issues a year, monographs and/

journal. The journal is open to contributions in all fields studying the
history of textual practices, hermeneutics and philology, philological
controversies, and the intellectual and global history of writing, archiving,
tradition-making and publishing. Neither confined to any discipline nor bound
by any geographical or temporal limits, Philological Encounters takes as its
point of departure the growing concern with the global significance of
philology and the potential of historically conscious and politically critical
philology to challenge exclusivist notions of the self and the canon.
Philological Encounters welcomes innovative and critical contributions in the
form of articles as well as review articles, usually of two or three related
books, and preferably from different disciplines.

\*[**rhizomes**](http://www.rhizomes.net) oppose the idea that knowledge must
grow in a tree structure from previously accepted ideas. New thinking need not
follow established patterns. Rhizomes promotes experimental work located
outside current disciplines, work that has no proper location. As our name
suggests, works written in the spirit of Deleuzian approaches are welcomed but
not required. We are not interested in publishing texts that establish their
authority merely by affirming what is already believed. Instead, we encourage
migrations into new conceptual territories resulting from unpredictable
juxtapositions. 

[**RIDE**](http://ride.i-d-e.de/about/) is a review journal dedicated to
digital editions and resources. RIDE aims to direct attention to digital
editions and to provide a forum in which expert peers criticise and discuss the
efforts of digital editors in order to improve current practices and advance

only to the traditional virtues and vices of any edition, but also to the
progressing methodology and its technical implications. Read more about RIDE in

## T

[**TEXT: An Interdisciplinary Annual of Textual
Studies**](http://www.textual.org/)  endeavors to investigate the meaning and 
implications of textuality is designed to widen our understanding of how  new
developments in fields like codicology, material philology, art  history,
musicology and cultural studies are redefining and integrating  our notions of
what constitutes a text in diverse cultural contexts.

[**Textual Practice**](http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=rtpr20) is Britain’s principal international journal of radical literary studies, continually pressing theory into new engagements. Today, as customary relations among disciplines and media are questioned and transformed, Textual Practice works at the turning points of theory with politics, history and texts. It is intrigued by the processes through which hitherto marginal cultures of ethnicity and sexuality are becoming conceptually central, and by the consequences of these diverse disturbances for educational and cultural institutions.

[**Thresholds**](http://openthresholds.org/) is a digital journal for criticism in the spaces between, expected to debut Summer 2016. The journal's platform bears witness to the dynamic processes that constitute reading and writing by way of a split-screen digital architecture. On the left side of the screen, we publish short essays (essayer — trial, attempt, test). The right side of the screen is populated by the various text fragments, images, audio, and video clips that inspired the author and propelled the corresponding work. Unlike a footnote or endnote, these fragments are not explicitly harnessed to the essay's main body; they do not rustle the reader toward a specific interpretative conclusion. Instead, they invite the reader to engage in a series of generative traversals across the central threshold. In this way, thresholds models criticism as a restless and unruly venture that takes place in the spaces between readers, writers, and texts.

[**Transformations**](http://www.transformationsjournal.org) is an independent,
double-blind peer-reviewed electronic journal addressing the transformative
processes of new technologies and mediating practices that change the way we
think, feel and interact with others both in a contemporary and historical
sense. We welcome writing from the perspective of cultural theory, critical
philosophy, aesthetics, media studies and other humanities approaches.

## V

[**Vectors**](http://www.vectorsjournal.org/issues/index.php) maps the multiple
contours of daily life in an unevenly digital  era, crystallizing around themes
that highlight the social, political,  and cultural stakes of our increasingly
technologically-mediated  existence. As such, the journal speaks both
implicitly and explicitly to  key debates across varied disciplines, including
issues of  globalization, mobility, power, and access. Operating at the 
intersection of culture, creativity, and technology, the journal focuses  on
the myriad ways technology shapes, transforms, reconfigures, and/or  impedes
social relations, both in the past and in the present.
